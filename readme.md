# Physics
> A repo for my physics 20 & 30 course and the graphs I made with matplotlib for it.

## Usage
```python
python plotter.py <level> <unit> [<save>]
```

It will search the directory for the required unit, load the JSON files with the data, and plot it out.

If `save` is equal to either `1` or `true`, it will save an image file with the name of the course leven and unit to the current directory.
